Authentication consists of reliably identifying the principal associated with a request.
Authentication can be provided by technical means such as passwords and signing mes-
sages. The technical means create a chain of evidence that securely connects an incoming
request with a principal, perhaps by establishing that a message came from the same prin-
cipal as a previous message. The technical means may even be able to establish the real-
world identity of the principal.
Once the authentication mechanisms have identified the principal, there is a closely
related but distinct problem: can the principal be trusted? The authentication means may
be able to establish that the real-world identity for a principal is the person ¡°Alice,¡± but
other techniques are required to decide whether and how much to trust Alice. The trad-
ing service may decide to consider Alice¡¯s request because the trading service can, by
technical means, establish that Alice¡¯s credit card number is valid. To be more precise,
the trading service trusts the credit card company to come through with the money and
relies on the credit card company to establish the trust that Alice will pay her credit card
bill.
The authenticity and trust problems are connected through the name of the princi-
pal. The technical means establish the name of the principal. Names for principals come
in many flavors: for example, the name might be a symbolic one, like ¡°Alice¡±, a credit
card number, a pseudonym, or a cryptographic key. The psychological techniques estab-
lish trust in the principal¡¯s name. For example, a reporter might trust information from
an anonymous informer who has a pseudonym because previous content of the messages
connected with the pseudonym has always been correct.
